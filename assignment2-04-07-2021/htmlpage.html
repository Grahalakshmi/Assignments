                            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                            HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                            HTML consists of a series of elements
                            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

                            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
            
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
